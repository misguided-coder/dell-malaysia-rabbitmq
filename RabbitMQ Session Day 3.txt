Virtual Host
	- is a logical container inside single RabbitMQ instance to holds all the messaging 
          components for a perticular client/application	
	- will provide neat and clean seperation layer between different projects		

RabbitMQ comes with a default virtual host with a name "/"

Use Case

customer 1 - WallMart
             Project 1 - Retail Market App
             Project 2 - Corporate Market App
             Project 3 - Backoffice App

customer 2 - Amazon

customer 3 - DBS

Security

Users
	- is a physical entity

Roles
        - is a logical entity and always mapped to users

Permissions (ACL)
	- list of ALLOWED/DENIED TODOs for specific users
        - configure operations
          (declare,delete) on exchanges/queues
        - write operations
          send message to exchanges/queues
        - read operations
          consume message from exchanges/queues
	- regexp/wildcard patterns

Level One of Access Grant is VIRTUALHOST
Level Two of Access Grant is RESOURCE
a) exchange is a resource (regex syntax)
b) queue is a resource (regex syntax)


Policies 
	- is a group of parameters/configurations/features applied to queues/exchanges/both
	- make it easy to apply same set of features on multiple queues/exchanges automatically 
          without any manual/repetetive admin work
	- can be created in advance as per my organitaion requirements by a guy who understands 
          requirements very well and knows which SLAs to follow at queue/exchange level (policymaker)
	- standard policy, cluster/HA policy, federation policy
	- will be applied using regex pattern

Use Case
	1) Create 5 queues with same set of features
	2) Create 2 queues with are having same quota limit
	3) Create 4 queues with are having message lost recovery using DLX/DLQ

Cluster
	- a group of RabbitMQ server nodes running together as a single node to outside world
	- to setup distributed RabbitMQ brokers
	- to provide a scalabale environment 
        - highily available (HA) messaging system/environment (100% uptime) (fail-over)
	- load balanced client application(sender/receiver)
        - each node will be a replica of other nodes 
        - exchanges/bindings/policies/virtualhosts/users are replicated by default
        - queue replication is not automatic and needs configuration using "mirror plugin" - HA
	- queue is globally available in the entire cluster and can be looked up and 
	  seen from any node in the cluster to acheive load balancing and scalability
	- master/slave configuration
      
Cluster Topology

1) Same machine cluster
2) Different machine cluster

Mirror Plugin
        - is used for queue replication 
	- is used to make cluster HA

Cluster Setup steps

1) Change each node name to be unique
2) Change each node all ports
3) Start each node one by one
4) Join slaves with master using commands
5) Check the status of cluster is up/not
6) Test your cluster

Cluster Testing
1) Load balancing is working or not
2) Fair Over is working or not

Testing Use Cases
1) Create a new virtual host on master and check whether it is replicated to slave or not
2) Create a new user host on master and check whether it is replicated to slave or not
3) Create a new policy on master and check whether it is replicated to slave or not
4) Create a new exchange on master and check whether it is replicated to slave or not
5) Create a new queue on master and check whether it is replicated to slave or not
  7) Create a sender to send few messages on a queue on the master node in the cluster and then 
   shut down the master node which physically contains the queue and then run a receiver to 
   receive messages  from the same queue using slave node in the same cluster (Fail Over - HA)
