RabbitMQ Prrequisites

1) 2-3 years of some admin/dev exp

Methodology used
20% theory/concept
80% practical

First Steps

System Ready
Windows 10 machines 2-4 GB with Admin Rights

RabbitMQ installation (Open Source)

   d) test/verify 
2) RabbitMQ
   a) download
   b) install
   c) configure
        PATH = blah;blah;blah;%ERLANG_HOME%\bin;C:\Program Files\RabbitMQ Server\rabbitmq_server-3.7.7\sbin

RabbitMQ Management
1) Command Line Interface (CLI) - rabbitmqctl.bat
2) Graphical Interface  (GUI) - comes as a plugin ( rabbitmq_management,rabbitmq_management_agent )

RabbitMQ Broker Concepts

   Exchange Types 
   i)  Direct - supports binding key only
   ii) Fanout - supports no binding key (mindless broadcasting)
   iii)Topic -  supports binding pattern
   iv) Headers - supports message header used for routing 
     
6) Queues - is used as a message store
7) Binding - is the link between exchange and queue
   i) can be done from queue side to exchange side
   ii) can be done from exchange side to queue side
   
8) Binding keys/patterns/headers - is used to setup link between exchange and queue
9) Routing key - is sent kept inside message by the sender and used by the exchange to decide where to route the message to
10) Connections - is the physical TCP connection between sender/receiver application and broker
11) Channels - is the virtual connection over which messaging takes place
12) Virtual Hosts - is used to seperate a single RabbitMQ instance to host multiple applications in different spaces
13) Users - can be added with different priviledges
14) Policies/Permmissions - can be used to define ACL
15) Plugins  - are used to extend product functionalities 
16) Cluster  - group of RabbitMQ nodes
