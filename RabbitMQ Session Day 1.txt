   iii)Topic -  supports binding pattern
   iv) Headers - supports message header used for routing 
     
6) Queues - is used as a message store
7) Binding - is the link between exchange and queue
   i) can be done from queue side to exchange side
   ii) can be done from exchange side to queue side
   
8) Binding keys/patterns/headers - is used to setup link between exchange and queue
9) Routing key - is sent kept inside message by the sender and used by the exchange to decide where to route the message to
10) Connections - is the physical TCP connection between sender/receiver application and broker
11) Channels - is the virtual connection over which messaging takes place
12) Virtual Hosts - is used to seperate a single RabbitMQ instance to host multiple applications in different spaces
13) Users - can be added with different priviledges
14) Policies/Permmissions - can be used to define ACL
15) Plugins  - are used to extend product functionalities
